## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.
- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's what we're going to use).

- **ggplot2** is tidyverse's data visualization package

## Grammar of Graphics

A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic.

## Hello ggplot2!

- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2 
- Plots are constructed in layers
- Structure of the code for plots can be summarized as
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], 
       mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```

## Additional variables

We can map additional variables to various features of the plot:

- aesthetics
    - shape
    - colour
    - fill
    - size
    - alpha (transparency)
- faceting: small multiples displaying different subsets

# Aesthetics

---

## Aesthetics options

Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to a specific variable**
in the data are

- `color`
- `size`
- `fill`
- `shape`
- `alpha` (transparency)

## Mass vs. height + gender

Let's now increase the size of all points *not* based on the values of a 
variable in the data, i.e. **set** size instead of **map** size:

.midi[
```{r out.width="63%", warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) #<<
```
]

---

## Aesthetics summary

- Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

aesthetics    | discrete                 | continuous
------------- | ------------------------ | ------------
color         | rainbow of colors        | gradient
size          | discrete steps           | linear mapping between radius and value
shape         | different shape for each | *shouldn't (and doesn't) work*

- Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable, define the 
features in the geom for customization **not** mapped to a variable

# Faceting

## Faceting

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data
- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

```{r fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) + #<<

# Identifying variables

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively. 
- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering. R uses the term 
**factor** for most categorical data.
